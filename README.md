This project demonstrates the working of an array data structure in the C programming language.
It allows users to perform basic operations on an array such as:
Insert an element at the end
Delete an element at a specific index
Search for an element in the array
Display all elements of the array
The project helps in understanding how arrays are stored in contiguous memory, how elements are accessed using indices, and how basic array operations are implemented programmatically.
Features
Interactive menu-driven program.
Supports dynamic insertion and deletion of elements.
Provides search functionality to locate any element.
Displays the array at any stage to visualize changes.
Learning Outcome
Understanding of array data structure in C.
Implementation of basic array operations.
Introduction to menu-driven programs and user interaction.
